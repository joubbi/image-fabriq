# CIS 1.3.2 Ensure sudo commands use pty (Scored)
# sudo can be run only from a psuedo-pty. 
# Rationale:
# Attackers can run a malicious program using sudo which would fork a background process
# that remains even when the main program has finished executing.
Defaults use_pty

# CIS 1.3.3 Ensure sudo log file exists (Scored)
# A separate sudo log file simplifies auditing of sudo commands.
Defaults logfile="/var/log/sudo.log"
